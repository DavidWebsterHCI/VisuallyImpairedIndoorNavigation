# VisuallyImpairedIndoorNavigation
Sep-Dec 2012 - Android app to enable VI users to navigate indoors

This app works by triangulating the user's distance between various bluetooth beacons based on their signal strength.
A video demo of the system in action can be found at http://youtu.be/CYQ7AvyzTlk

Note: Although this app's codebase has (many) various (and notable) flaws, it was my first venture into the world of android, 
as well as being a prototype effort, not a finished product.  I document it here for historical reasons. Once I graduated it 
was extended and used for further research which I was not part of.
